# WD-BASS
White Dwarf Binary And Single Star (WD-BASS) package for spectral fitting

# How to get started?
There is a manual and flowchart to assist in its use. I also have made a series of youtube videos to refer to with the most common uses.

# Usage of the package and citation
WD-BASS was first introduced in Munday et al 2024 for use with the DBL survey and the outline of the most important technical details of the package is stated in Section 4 of this work. If there are updates, I will include these by default into WD-BASS and include a change log in the manual. 

If you use WD-BASS in your research, you must cite Munday et al 2024 and I ask that you include a footnote pointing readers to this github page at the same time. If you wish to develop your own code and you put lines of code or subroutines from WD-BASS your own scripts, you must cite Munday et al 2024 but there is no need to include a footnote to the github page (with the only exceptions that are freely utilisable being the load_All_Models.py, miscAstro.py and Stilism.py).

As a last request, if you have any suggestions on how to improve the function or efficiency of the code, if you find a bug, or you would like me to include e.g. a different synthetic spectral grid or new cooling sequences into WD-BASS, please contact me via email at james.munday98(at)gmail.com or raise an issue on Github. I have invested many hours into this package and I hope that it assists you in your research! I would love to talk about your research or project ideas with this code, so you are more than welcome to contact me about this at any time. I am happy to collaborate and fit your spectra upon request too. This is especially relevant for if you are fitting binaries (single or double lined) which are more challenging as the parameters are more degenerate.
