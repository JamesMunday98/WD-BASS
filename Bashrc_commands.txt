### IMPORANT --- Number of cores:  The performance benefits from multiple cores. To change the number of cores that will be used, edit anywhere that says "mpiexec -np 3 ", where the number "3" signifies that 3 cores will be used. To see how many cores you have, you can use e.g. htop.
### INSTALL  --- Type "cd" -> e.g. "nano .bashrc". Replace '/home/james/python_scripts_path/dwd_fit_package/'  with your install location (on text editor, use the "Find and Replace" tool) and copy the lines into your bashrc. Close and open terminal (or execute "source .bashrc"). Now, every time you open a new terminal these commands will be available for you to type.
